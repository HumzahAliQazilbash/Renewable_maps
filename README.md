# Renewable_maps
Automated code to showcase all the renewable projects in a country.  Code is currently work in progress and am fixing bugs to do with windows compatablility and file paths.

Run: 
`$python create_RES_maps.py`
The output will produce a jpeg for the relevant project entered, only showing data for the relevant country.

All data comes from Berkleys Dataset for Verra Renewable projects.
